# Optimal designs for testing pairwise differences: a graph based game theoretic approach

# Description
This repository contains all the original R codes used for the numerical studies in the work **Optimal designs for testing pairwise differences: a graph based game theoretic approach** by **_Arpan Singh, Satya Prakash Singh and Ori davidov_**.

# Instructions
To reproduce the results use the codes given in this repository. 

1) Name of the main files and the R codes are self-explainatory. For example the file **Table 1 Supplement (UIT Tree)** contains all the R codes used to produce the results given in the **Table 1** in the **Supplementary material**, in which **Tree** comparison is done for the **UITs**. 
2) Further, the R code **UIT_tree_K3.r**  in the aforementioned file produce the max--min design for the **Tree** graph for **K=3 groups** when **UIT** test is used.
3) The following packages are required to use these codes,\
      a) **nloptr**\
      b) **mvtnorm**
